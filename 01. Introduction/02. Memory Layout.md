### Memory Layout of C/C++ Programs

Basically, the memory layout of a C program contains five segments: the Stack segment, Heap segment, BSS (block started by symbol), DS (Data Segment) and Text segment. Each segment has its own read, write and executable permission. If a program tries to access the memory in a way that is not allowed then segmentation fault occurs.

Low Addresses ----> '----------------------'
```

1. **Stack:** It is located at a higher address and grows and shrinks opposite to the heap segment. Stack is used to store all local variables and is used for passing arguments to the functions. A stack frame or activation record will be created in the Stack when a function is called. Each function has one stack frame. Stack frames contain the function’s local variables arguments and return value. The stack contains a LIFO structure. Function variables are pushed onto the stack when called and function variables are popped off the stack when return. SP(stack pointer) register tracks the top of the stack. All recursive function calls are added to the Stack only.

   ```c
   int main()
   {
      int data; //local variable stored in Stack
      return 0;
   }
   ```

2. **Heap:** It is used to allocate the memory at runtime. Heap area managed by the memory management functions like malloc, calloc, free, etc which may internally use the brk and sbrk system calls to adjust its size. The Heap area is shared by all shared libraries and dynamically loaded modules in a process. It grows and shrinks in the opposite direction of the stack.

   ```c
    int main()
   {
      char *p=(char*)malloc(sizeof(char));  //memory allocation in Heap memory
      return 0;
   }
   ```

3. **BSS (Uninitialized data segment):** It contains all uninitialized global and static variables. All variables in this segment are initialized by the zero(0) and pointer with the null pointer. The program loader allocates memory for the BSS section when it loads the program.

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   int data1; // Uninitialized global variable stored in BSS
   int main()
   {
       static int data2;  // Uninitialized static variable stored in BSS
       return 0;
   }
   ```

4. **DS (Initialized data segment):** It contains the explicitly initialized global and static variables. The size of this segment is determined by the size of the values in the program’s source code and does not change at run time. It has read-write permission so the value of the variable of this segment can be changed at run time. This segment can be further classified into an initialized read-only area and an initialized read-write area.

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   int data1 = 10 ;  //Initialized global variable stored in DS(read-write area)
   const char name[]="altafjava";  //Initialized global variable stored in DS(read-only area)
   int main()
   {
       static int data2 = 3; //Initialized static variable stored in DS
       return 0;
   }
   ```

5. **Text or Code Segment:** Text segment contains machine code of the compiled program. The text segment is a read-only segment that prevents a program from being accidentally modified. It is sharable so that only a single copy needs to be in memory for frequently executed programs such as text editors, the C compiler, the shells, etc.
