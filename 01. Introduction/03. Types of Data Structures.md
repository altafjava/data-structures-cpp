### Types of Data Structures

There are two types of data structures in terms of storing data into storage devices.

1. Physical Data Structure
2. Logical Data Structure

**Physical Data Structure:** A physical data structure refers to the actual organization of data on a storage device. Array and LinkedList are the two physical data structures. We can have more physical data structures by taking the combination of these two data structures.

_Array:_ Array is directly supported by various programming languages such as C, C++, C#, Java, etc. Array is a collection of contiguous memory locations. Array stores elements of the same type. Array is fixed in nature. It means once it is created with some size then that size cannot be increased or decreased. Array can be created either inside the Stack or Heap. We need to use the Array data structure when we are sure about the maximum number of elements that we are going to store.

_Linked List:_ Linked List is a completely dynamic data structure. It is a collection of nodes where each node contains data and a link to the next node. The length of the linked list can grow and reduce dynamically. So it has a variable length. Linked list is always created in the Heap memory i.e. collection of nodes is created always in heap and can be accessed by using a pointer and that pointer is created inside the Stack memory. We should use Linked list when we are not sure what is the maximum number of elements we are going to store.

**Logical Data Structure:** A logical data structure refers to how the information/data appears to a program or user. These are the logical data structures:

1. Stack
2. Queue
3. Tree
4. Graph
5. Hash Table

We can also categorize data structure in terms of how they store the data:

1. Linear Data structure: A Linear data structure has data elements arranged in a sequential manner and each element is connected to its previous and next adjacent element. In linear data structure, a single level is involved. Therefore, we can traverse all the elements in a single run only. Linear data structures are easy to implement because computer memory is arranged in a linear way. Example: Array, LinkedList, Stack, Queue.

2. Non linear data structure: Data structures where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, a single level is not involved. Therefore, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only. Non-linear data structures are not easy to implement in comparison to linear data structures. It utilizes computer memory efficiently in comparison to a linear data structure. Example: Trees, Graphs.
